/**Using this strategy, each class in the hierarchy is mapped to its table. The only column which repeatedly appears in
 * all the tables is the identifier, which will be used for joining them when needed.
 * The disadvantage of this inheritance mapping method is that retrieving entities requires joins between tables, which
 * can result in lower performance for large numbers of records.
 *
 * The number of joins is higher when querying the parent class as it will join with every single related child â€“ so
 * performance is more likely to be affected the higher up the hierarchy we want to retrieve records.*/
